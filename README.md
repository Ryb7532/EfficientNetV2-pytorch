# EfficientNetV2-pytorch

## overview

The implemantations of EfficientNet V1 and V2 using PyTorch.
It's heavily referred to the original tensorflow [implementation](https://github.com/google/automl/blob/master/efficientnetv2) and torchvision.
For EfficientNet V1, you can use the pretrained model (load the models used by torchvision).


I still haven't fully confirmed that it works.


If you have any questions, feel free to comment.
