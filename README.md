# EfficientNetV2-pytorch

## overview

The PyTorch implemantations of EfficientNet V1 and V2, presented in the paper:

- [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le.
- [EfficientNetV2: Smaller Models and Faster Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298), by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le.

It's heavily referred to the original tensorflow [implementation](https://github.com/google/automl/blob/master/efficientnetv2) and torchvision.
For EfficientNet V1, you can use the pretrained model (load the models used by torchvision).


I still haven't fully confirmed that it works.


If you have any questions, feel free to comment.
